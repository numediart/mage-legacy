1. This has been tested on linux only for now, maybe it could work on OSX with appropriate suffix change ?
2. make sure that libmage.so and libhtsengine.so are in pd path ('ln -s' them in /usr/local/lib for instance) or in the same folder as mage~.pd_linux
3. make sure that the "inout" folder is in the same folder as mage~.pd_linux since it looks for "./inouts/slt.conf" and all associated files (models, trees, labels, ...)
4. No input parameters for the moment, it's just a loop over alice01.lab. Ideally it should take messages as input a bit like OSC messages, only simplified.
