in order to compile with linux :

0. have magelib-2.00 compiled (see README there)
1. have openframeworks for linux installed somewhere on system. This is a bit tricky but it is possible (TODO write a manual for this)
2. change examples/of_0071_linux_release/apps/enterface2012/CMakeLists.txt ${OF_ROOT_PATH} variable to your path to openframeworks
3. in examples/of_0071_linux_release/apps:
   $ mkdir -p builds/linux-x64-release/
   $ cd builds/linux-x64-release/
   $ cmake ../..
   $ make
4. for debug:
   $ mkdir -p builds/linux-x64-debug/
   $ cd builds/linux-x64-debug/
   $ cmake ../.. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
(or use ccmake after cmake ../.., to change BUILD_TYPE option to Debug)
   $ make
